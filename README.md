This project, Vehicle Rent Management System, has been developed by Tanvi H. Taraviya as part of the academic requirements for the Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) program during the sixth semester at Shree H.N. Shukla College of IT & Management, affiliated with Saurashtra University.

Under the valuable guidance of Mrs. Karishma Rupani, this system was designed and implemented to offer a modern solution to traditional vehicle rental operations. The goal of the project is to create a web-based platform that allows easy booking and management of rental vehicles while ensuring real-time availability, simplified processes, and efficient administrative control.

This application leverages the Django web framework, combining the power of Python with frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to provide a complete and practical solution tailored for rental agencies. It reflects a hands-on application of the knowledge and skills acquired throughout the course and serves as a stepping stone towards real-world software development.
