This project is a backend-only REST API built using Django and the Django Rest Framework (DRF). It is designed to handle structured data operations efficiently, with all interactions handled through POST-based endpoints. The project does not include any frontend interface, making it ideal for integration into external systems such as mobile apps, web clients, or automation scripts.

The API also includes custom search functionality, allowing flexible and powerful filtering based on specific parameters. All endpoints return responses in JSON format and have been tested using Pythonâ€™s requests library for accuracy and real-world usability.

Whether you're building a new application or connecting with third-party services, this backend system provides a strong, secure, and scalable foundation
